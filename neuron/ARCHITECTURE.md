Core Implementation Files
neuron.go

Embeds *component.BaseComponent for shared functionality
Implements all component interfaces (ChemicalReceiver, ElectricalReceiver, MessageReceiver)
Contains neuron-specific fields (threshold, accumulator, homeostatic metrics)
Creates and manages dendrite instance
Handles component lifecycle (Start/Stop)
Acts as integration layer between component system and dendrite
Manages callback-based outputs to synapses
Implements spatial positioning and metadata management

dendrite.go 

All existing complex dendrite logic unchanged
Input processing algorithms and coincidence detection
Synaptic integration and filtering
Only interface changes: accepts message.NeuralSignal, returns processed values
Internal complexity preserved exactly as-is
Branch-specific processing and dendritic computation

callbacks.go

Defines NeuronCallbacks struct with matrix service functions
Defines OutputCallback struct for direct synapse communication
Defines NeuronInterface for matrix interaction
Configuration types for synapse creation requests
Callback injection mechanisms and interface contracts

factory.go

CallbackNeuronFactory function for component-based creation
NeuronConfig struct using component and message types only
Specialized factory variants (homeostatic, excitatory, inhibitory)
Factory registration system for matrix integration
Configuration validation and default value handling

firing.go

Firing decision logic and threshold processing
Callback-based output transmission to synapses
Chemical release coordination via matrix callbacks
Electrical signal broadcasting for gap junctions
Refractory period management
Output value calculation and distribution

processing.go

Background processing loop (Run() method)
Input message queue processing from dendrite
Decay and homeostatic update cycles
Integration with component lifecycle
Message buffering and overflow handling
Timing coordination for biological realism


ðŸ§ª Test File Purposes
Existing Tests (Preserved)

dendrite_*.go - All your existing complex dendrite testing preserved
Minimal changes needed (just message type updates)

New Component Tests

neuron_test.go - Test component integration and interface implementation
callback_test.go - Test callback injection, matrix interaction, output delivery
factory_test.go - Test factory functions and configuration handling
firing_test.go - Test firing mechanisms and callback-based transmission
integration_test.go - Test neuron-dendrite integration and full signal flow
performance_test.go - Benchmark overall neuron performance with component base

Migrated Tests

homeostatic_test.go - From your old files, test homeostatic plasticity
synaptic_scaling_test.go - From your old files, test synaptic scaling mechanisms


ðŸ”„ Integration Flow
Message Reception:
message.NeuralSignal â†’ neuron.Receive() â†’ dendrite.ProcessInput() â†’ accumulator â†’ firing decision
Component Integration:
Neuron acts as adapter between component system and your complex dendrite logic, preserving all dendrite sophistication while enabling component-based architecture.
