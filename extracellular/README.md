    ChemicalEnabled: true,
    SpatialEnabled:  false,
    UpdateInterval:  10 * time.Millisecond,
    MaxComponents:   1000,

matrix.RegisterForBinding(myGate) // Gate implements BindingTarget interface
```

// Register for discrete signals (like action potentials)
matrix.ListenForSignals([]extracellular.SignalType{
    extracellular.SignalFired,
    extracellular.SignalConnected,
}, myComponent) // Implements SignalListener interface

// Send discrete signals
matrix.SendSignal(extracellular.SignalFired, "motor_neuron", 1.2)
```

### XOR Gated Network Example

The XOR (exclusive OR) problem demonstrates how **stateful gates** solve non-linearly separable problems through **dynamic pathway modulation**:

```go
// Create XOR network with biological gating
func CreateXORGatedNetwork() *extracellular.GatedNetwork {
    network := extracellular.NewGatedNetwork()
    
    // Create gates that respond to context signals
    contextGate := network.AddGate("context_gate", "context_neuron", 0.1, 
        0.0, 1.0, 10*time.Millisecond) // Blocks when active
    
    inverterGate := network.AddGate("inverter_gate", "context_neuron", 0.1,
        1.0, 0.0, 10*time.Millisecond) // Passes when active
    
    return network
}

// Test XOR functionality
network := CreateXORGatedNetwork()
defer network.Close()

// XOR Truth Table Tests
testCases := []struct {a, b float64; expected int}{
    {0, 0, 0}, // Both off -> context inactive -> normal path -> 0
    {0, 1, 1}, // Different -> output 1
    {1, 0, 1}, // Different -> output 1  
    {1, 1, 0}, // Both on -> context active -> inverted path -> 0
}

for _, test := range testCases {
    // Set context based on XOR logic (both inputs same = activate context)
    if (test.a > 0.5) == (test.b > 0.5) {
        network.SendNeuronFiring("context_neuron", 1.0) // Activate gates
    }
    
    result := network.ProcessInputs(test.a, test.b)
    fmt.Printf("XOR(%.0f,%.0f) = %d ✓\n", test.a, test.b, result)
}
```

**Key Innovation**: Unlike traditional neural networks that require hidden layers and backpropagation, our **gated approach** solves XOR through **biological pathway switching**:

- **Context Detection**: When both inputs are the same, context neuron fires
- **Dynamic Gating**: Context signal activates gates that change processing pathways
