### 1. `chemical_modulator.go`

This file is the most significant source of hardcoded parameters, primarily because it models specific biological constants.

* **Simulation Tick Rate:** The rate at which the chemical decay simulation runs is hardcoded to 1ms. This is a critical parameter that affects performance and accuracy.
    ```go
    // in biologicalDecayProcessor()
    ticker := time.NewTicker(1 * time.Millisecond) 
    ```

* **Binding and Decay Thresholds:** The values used to decide if a chemical concentration is significant enough to act upon or should be removed are hardcoded.
    ```go
    // in processImmediateBinding()
    if effectiveConcentration > 0.001 { // 1 μM threshold

    // in processBiologicalDecay()
    if newConcentration < cm.getBiologicalThreshold(ligandType) {
    ```
    The `getBiologicalThreshold` function itself contains multiple hardcoded values for each ligand (`0.01`, `0.001`, `0.005`).

* **Biological Kinetics:** The entire `initializeBiologicalKinetics` function is a block of hardcoded constants for diffusion, decay, clearance, range, etc. While these are based on scientific literature, making them configurable would allow for "what-if" scenarios or modeling different tissue types.
    ```go
    // in initializeBiologicalKinetics()
    cm.ligandKinetics[LigandGlutamate] = LigandKinetics{
        DiffusionRate:   0.76,  // Measured: 760 μm²/s = 0.76 μm²/ms
        DecayRate:       200.0, // Fast enzymatic breakdown
        ClearanceRate:   300.0, // Rapid EAAT transporter uptake (Vmax ~500/s)
        MaxRange:        5.0,   // Spillover range ~1-2 μm, buffered to 5μm
        // ... and so on for all neurotransmitters
    }
    ```

* **Rate Limiting Constants:** The maximum release rates for neurotransmitters are defined as package-level constants.
    ```go
    const (
        GLUTAMATE_MAX_RATE     = 500.0
        GABA_MAX_RATE          = 500.0
        // ... and so on
    )
    ```


### 3. `gap_junctions.go`

This file has one notable hardcoded value.

* **Signal History Size:** The maximum number of signal events to store in memory is fixed. For very long or complex simulations, a user might want to increase this for better analysis or decrease it to save memory.
    ```go
    // in NewGapJunctions()
    return &GapJunctions{
        // ...
        maxHistory:    1000, // Keep last 1000 signals
    }
    ```

### Summary and Recommendations

Your code is functionally excellent, but its behavior is defined by these compile-time constants. To elevate the project to a truly flexible simulation platform, you should externalize these parameters.

**Recommendation: Introduce Configuration Structs**

The best practice is to create specific configuration structs for each major component and pass them in during initialization.

1.  Create structs like `MicrogliaConfig`, `ChemicalModulatorConfig`, etc.
2.  Populate these structs with the hardcoded values identified above.
3.  Modify the constructors (`NewMicroglia`, `NewChemicalModulator`) to accept these config structs.
4.  Store the config on the component's struct.
5.  Replace the hardcoded magic numbers in the logic with the corresponding values from the stored config struct.
