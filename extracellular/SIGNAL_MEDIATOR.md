# SignalMediator - Biological Electrical Signaling System

**A high-performance implementation of electrical synapses (gap junctions) for biologically-realistic neural network coordination**

## üß† Overview

The SignalMediator implements **electrical synapses** (gap junctions) - the fast, bidirectional communication channels found in real neural networks. Unlike chemical synapses that use neurotransmitters, electrical synapses allow direct electrical coupling between neurons through gap junction proteins, enabling near-instantaneous signal transmission and network synchronization.

### Biological Context

In real brains, electrical synapses serve crucial functions:
- **Network Synchronization**: Enable groups of inhibitory interneurons to fire in unison, creating brain wave oscillations like gamma waves (30-100 Hz)
- **Rapid Reflex Pathways**: Provide ultra-fast communication where speed is more critical than complex computation
- **Developmental Coordination**: Synchronize activity of developing neurons during brain formation
- **Oscillatory Networks**: Generate rhythmic patterns essential for motor control, attention, and memory

### Key Characteristics
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Unlike chemical synapses, electrical synapses transmit signals in both directions
- **Ultra-Fast Transmission**: Virtually no delay (0.31 Œºs per signal in our implementation)
- **Variable Conductance**: Gap junction conductance can range from 0.1-1.0 nS, controlling coupling strength
- **Synchronization Networks**: Enable precise timing coordination across neuron populations
