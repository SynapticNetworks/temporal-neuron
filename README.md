## ⚠️ Research Project - Early Stage Development

**This is an active research project in early development.** We are exploring biologically-inspired neural computation as an alternative to traditional artificial neural networks. The API is experimental and subject to change.

### Research Goals
- Eliminate artificial constraints of traditional ANNs (batches, activation functions, synchronous processing)
- Explore massive concurrent neural processing using Go's goroutines
- Build foundations for future stateful gating networks and advanced learning algorithms
- Study real-time neural dynamics and emergent network behaviors

### Current Status: Heavy Work in Progress 🚧
This repository contains the foundational neuron implementation with biologically realistic features including refractory periods and leaky integration. Much more is planned and under development.

## 🧠 Overview

Traditional artificial neural networks suffer from fundamental limitations that make them unrealistic compared to biological brains:

- **Batch/Iteration Processing**: Traditional ANNs process data in discrete batches or training iterations
- **Complex Activation Functions**: Artificial mathematical functions (sigmoid, ReLU, etc.) that don't exist in biology
- **Synchronous Operation**: All neurons process simultaneously in lockstep
- **Static Architecture**: Fixed connectivity that can't adapt during operation

**Real biological neurons operate completely differently:**
- **Continuous Processing**: Always active, processing signals as they arrive
- **Simple Threshold Behavior**: Fire when electrical charge exceeds threshold (no complex math)
- **Asynchronous Operation**: Each neuron operates independently with its own timing
- **Dynamic Connectivity**: Constantly growing and pruning connections
- **Refractory Periods**: Cannot fire immediately after firing (recovery time)
- **Leaky Integration**: Membrane potential naturally decays over time

**Temporal Neuron** eliminates these artificial constraints by providing Go implementations that work like real brains:

- **No Iterations/Batches**: Continuous real-time processing without artificial training epochs
- **No Activation Functions**: Simple threshold-based firing like real neurons
- **True Asynchronous Processing**: Each neuron operates independently on its own timeline
- **Biological Timing**: Refractory periods and membrane potential decay
- **Massive Scalability**: Go routines enable networks with millions of concurrent neurons
- **Real-time Response**: Sub-millisecond processing with no batch delays

## 🎯 Key Features

### Revolutionary Approach
- **Iteration-Free**: No training epochs, backpropagation, or batch processing—just continuous operation
- **No Mathematical Activation Functions**: Simple biological threshold firing (charge > threshold = fire)
- **Massive Concurrency**: Leverage Go's lightweight goroutines for networks with 100k+ neurons
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-millisecond response times for live data streams
- **Event-Driven**: Neurons only consume resources when actively processing signals

### Biological Realism
- **Leaky Integration**: Continuous membrane potential decay models biological membrane time constants
- **Refractory Periods**: Neurons cannot fire immediately after firing, preventing unrealistic rapid bursts
- **Threshold Firing**: Fires action potentials when accumulated charge reaches threshold
- **Synaptic Delays**: Realistic transmission delays based on connection properties
- **Parallel Transmission**: Single action potential propagates to all connected neurons simultaneously

### Dynamic Architecture
- **Runtime Connectivity**: Add/remove connections while neurons are actively processing
- **Synaptic Plasticity**: Modify connection strengths and delays during operation
- **Scalable Networks**: Build networks of arbitrary size and topology
- **Connection Management**: Named connections for easy identification and modification

### Concurrency & Real-time Performance
- **Goroutine-per-Neuron**: Each neuron is an independent goroutine (10M+ goroutines possible)
- **Lock-free Communication**: Message passing through Go channels eliminates blocking
- **Elastic Scaling**: Add/remove neurons dynamically without affecting the rest of the network
- **Memory Efficient**: ~2KB per neuron, scales linearly with network size
- **Live Processing**: Handle streaming data with microsecond latencies

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/SynapticNetworks/temporal-neuron
```

### Real-time Processing Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
    "github.com/SynapticNetworks/temporal-neuron/neuron"
)

func main() {
    // Create a neuron with biological parameters:
    // - id: "neuron1" (for identification)
    // - threshold: 1.0 (firing threshold)
    // - decayRate: 0.95 (5% membrane potential decay per millisecond)
    // - refractoryPeriod: 10ms (cannot fire for 10ms after firing)
    // - fireFactor: 1.0 (output signal strength)
    n := neuron.NewNeuron("neuron1", 1.0, 0.95, 10*time.Millisecond, 1.0)
    
    // Create output channel to capture fired signals
    output := make(chan neuron.Message, 10)
    
    // Connect with realistic 5ms transmission delay
    n.AddOutput("output1", output, 1.0, 5*time.Millisecond)
    
    // Start continuous processing (no iterations/epochs!)
    go n.Run()
    
    // Send real-time signals
    input := n.GetInput()
    input <- neuron.Message{Value: 0.7}  // Below threshold - no firing
    input <- neuron.Message{Value: 0.5}  // Total: ~1.2 > 1.0 - FIRES!
    
    // Immediate response (real-time)
    fired := <-output
    fmt.Printf("Neuron fired: %.2f (processing time: ~5ms)\n", fired.Value)
}
```

### Massive Concurrent Network

```go
// Create 10,000 neurons running concurrently (real-time!)
neurons := make([]*neuron.Neuron, 10000)
for i := range neurons {
    neuronID := fmt.Sprintf("neuron_%d", i)
    neurons[i] = neuron.NewNeuron(neuronID, 1.0, 0.95, 5*time.Millisecond, 1.0)
    go neurons[i].Run() // Each neuron is an independent goroutine
}

// Connect them in a random network topology
for i := 0; i < len(neurons)-1; i++ {
    // Random connections with biological delays
    delay := time.Duration(rand.Intn(20)+1) * time.Millisecond
    neurons[i].AddOutput(
        fmt.Sprintf("to_%d", i+1),
        neurons[i+1].GetInputChannel(),
        0.8 + rand.Float64()*0.4, // Random synaptic strength
        delay,
    )
}

// Send signals into the network - watch them propagate in real-time!
neurons[0].GetInput() <- neuron.Message{Value: 2.0}
// Activity will cascade through the network asynchronously
```

## 📖 Documentation

### Core Concepts

#### No Activation Functions
Traditional neural networks use complex mathematical functions (sigmoid, ReLU, tanh) that don't exist in biology. Real neurons simply fire when electrical charge exceeds a threshold:

```go
// Traditional ANN (artificial):
// output = sigmoid(sum(weights * inputs) + bias)

// Biological neuron (this library):
// if accumulator >= threshold { fire() }
```

Our neurons use the same simple rule that biological neurons follow—no complex mathematics required.

#### Leaky Integration (No Time Windows)
Traditional neural networks process inputs instantaneously. Biological neurons continuously integrate signals with natural decay:

```go
// Traditional approach:
// output = activation(sum(inputs))  // Instantaneous

// Biological approach (this library):
// accumulator += input              // Continuous integration
// accumulator *= decayRate          // Natural membrane decay
// if accumulator >= threshold { fire() }
```

No artificial time windows—just continuous membrane dynamics like real neurons.

#### Refractory Periods
Real neurons cannot fire immediately after firing an action potential. This library models this biological constraint:

```go
// After firing, neuron cannot fire again for refractoryPeriod duration
// This prevents unrealistic rapid-fire bursts and models Na+ channel recovery
```

#### Massive Goroutine Scalability
Go's goroutines are incredibly lightweight (~2KB each), enabling networks with millions of concurrent neurons:

```go
// Create 1 million neurons - each running concurrently!
for i := 0; i < 1_000_000; i++ {
    neuronID := fmt.Sprintf("neuron_%d", i)
    n := neuron.NewNeuron(neuronID, rand.Float64(), 0.95, 5*time.Millisecond, 1.0)
    go n.Run() // Only ~2KB overhead per goroutine
}
```

Traditional frameworks can't achieve this level of true concurrency.

### API Reference

#### Neuron Creation
```go
func NewNeuron(id string, threshold float64, decayRate float64, refractoryPeriod time.Duration, fireFactor float64) *Neuron
```
- `id`: Unique identifier for this neuron
- `threshold`: Minimum accumulated value to trigger firing
- `decayRate`: Membrane potential decay factor (0.0-1.0, typically 0.95-0.99)
- `refractoryPeriod`: Duration after firing when neuron cannot fire again
- `fireFactor`: Multiplier applied to output signals

#### Connection Management
```go
func (n *Neuron) AddOutput(id string, channel chan Message, factor float64, delay time.Duration)
func (n *Neuron) RemoveOutput(id string)
func (n *Neuron) GetOutputCount() int
func (n *Neuron) GetInputChannel() chan Message  // For neuron-to-neuron connections
```

#### Operation
```go
func (n *Neuron) Run()              // Start neuron processing (call as goroutine)
func (n *Neuron) GetInput() chan<- Message  // Get input channel for sending signals
func (n *Neuron) Close()            // Gracefully shutdown neuron
```

#### Fire Event Monitoring
```go
func (n *Neuron) SetFireEventChannel(ch chan<- FireEvent)  // Monitor firing events
```

## 🔬 Examples

### Example 1: Leaky Integration
```go
// Demonstrates continuous membrane potential decay
neuron := neuron.NewNeuron("leaky_demo", 1.0, 0.9, 10*time.Millisecond, 1.0)
output := make(chan neuron.Message, 10)
neuron.AddOutput("out", output, 1.0, 0)

go neuron.Run()

// Send signal below threshold
input := neuron.GetInput()
input <- neuron.Message{Value: 0.8}  // Below threshold

// Wait for decay
time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)

// Send another signal - needs more due to decay
input <- neuron.Message{Value: 0.5}  // May not fire due to decay

// Check if fired
select {
case fired := <-output:
    fmt.Printf("Fired despite decay: %.2f\n", fired.Value)
case <-time.After(20 * time.Millisecond):
    fmt.Println("Did not fire - signal decayed")
}
```

### Example 2: Refractory Period
```go
// Demonstrates refractory period preventing rapid firing
neuron := neuron.NewNeuron("refractory_demo", 1.0, 0.95, 20*time.Millisecond, 1.0)
output := make(chan neuron.Message, 10)
neuron.AddOutput("out", output, 1.0, 0)

go neuron.Run()

input := neuron.GetInput()

// Fire first time
input <- neuron.Message{Value: 1.5}
<-output // Wait for first firing

// Try to fire immediately (should be blocked)
input <- neuron.Message{Value: 2.0}

// Check if second firing was blocked
select {
case <-output:
    fmt.Println("ERROR: Fired during refractory period!")
case <-time.After(10 * time.Millisecond):
    fmt.Println("Correctly blocked by refractory period")
}
```

### Example 3: Network with Feedback and Biological Timing
```go
// Create a network with realistic biological parameters
n1 := neuron.NewNeuron("excitatory", 1.0, 0.95, 8*time.Millisecond, 1.0)
n2 := neuron.NewNeuron("inhibitory", 0.8, 0.97, 5*time.Millisecond, 1.0)

// Forward excitatory connection: n1 -> n2
n1.AddOutput("forward", n2.GetInputChannel(), 1.2, 10*time.Millisecond)

// Feedback inhibitory connection: n2 -> n1
n2.AddOutput("feedback", n1.GetInputChannel(), -0.8, 15*time.Millisecond)

go n1.Run()
go n2.Run()

// Single input can cause oscillatory activity
n1.GetInput() <- neuron.Message{Value: 1.5}
```

### Example 4: Dynamic Network Reconfiguration
```go
// Build network that adapts its connectivity
source := neuron.NewNeuron("source", 0.5, 0.95, 5*time.Millisecond, 1.0)
target1 := neuron.NewNeuron("target1", 1.0, 0.95, 8*time.Millisecond, 1.0)
target2 := neuron.NewNeuron("target2", 1.0, 0.95, 8*time.Millisecond, 1.0)

// Initially connect only to target1
source.AddOutput("main", target1.GetInputChannel(), 1.0, 5*time.Millisecond)

go source.Run()
go target1.Run() 
go target2.Run()

// Later, dynamically add connection to target2
time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
source.AddOutput("secondary", target2.GetInputChannel(), 0.8, 8*time.Millisecond)

// Now signals from source reach both targets
source.GetInput() <- neuron.Message{Value: 1.0}
```
