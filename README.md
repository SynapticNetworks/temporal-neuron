## ⚠️ Research Project - Active Development

**This is an active research project exploring biologically-inspired neural computation.** We are building a complete neural substrate that eliminates artificial constraints of traditional neural networks while maintaining biological realism and computational efficiency.

### Research Goals
- Eliminate artificial constraints of traditional ANNs (batches, activation functions, synchronous processing)
- Create living neural networks with autonomous neurons and dynamic connectivity  
- Build foundations for stateful gating networks and advanced learning algorithms
- Study real-time neural dynamics and emergent network behaviors

### Current Status: Core Foundation Complete ✅
This repository now contains a robust foundation of biologically realistic neural components with comprehensive validation:

- **✅ Temporal Neurons**: Autonomous, concurrent neurons with STDP and homeostatic plasticity
- **✅ Synaptic Processors**: Intelligent synapses with learning and pruning capabilities  
- **🚧 Extracellular Matrix**: Coordination layer for dynamic network structure (in development)
- **🔄 NetworkGenome Manager**: Serialization and remote control (planned)

## 🧠 Revolutionary Approach

Traditional artificial neural networks suffer from fundamental limitations that make them unrealistic compared to biological brains:

### Traditional ANNs
- **Batch Processing**: Discrete training epochs and inference phases
- **Complex Activation Functions**: Mathematical abstractions (sigmoid, ReLU) that don't exist in biology
- **Synchronous Operation**: All neurons process simultaneously in lockstep
- **Static Architecture**: Fixed connectivity that can't adapt during operation
- **Dead Computation**: Networks only "think" when explicitly invoked

### Real Biological Neurons
- **Continuous Processing**: Always active, processing signals as they arrive
- **Simple Threshold Behavior**: Fire when electrical charge exceeds threshold
- **Asynchronous Operation**: Each neuron operates independently with its own timing
- **Dynamic Connectivity**: Constantly growing and pruning connections
- **Living Computation**: Networks maintain persistent activity and autonomous behavior

### Temporal Neuron Solution
**We eliminate these artificial constraints by creating neurons that truly live:**

- **✅ No Iterations/Batches**: Continuous real-time processing without artificial training epochs
- **✅ No Activation Functions**: Simple threshold-based firing like real neurons
- **✅ True Asynchronous Processing**: Each neuron operates independently on its own timeline
- **✅ Biological Timing**: Refractory periods and membrane potential decay
- **✅ Massive Scalability**: Go routines enable networks with 100K+ concurrent neurons
- **✅ Real-time Response**: Sub-millisecond processing with no batch delays
- **✅ Living Networks**: Persistent activity and autonomous structural changes

## 🎯 Key Features

### Biological Realism
- **Multi-Timescale Plasticity**: STDP (ms), homeostasis (sec-min), synaptic scaling (min-hours)
- **Leaky Integration**: Continuous membrane potential decay with biological time constants
- **Refractory Periods**: Neurons cannot fire immediately after firing
- **Threshold Firing**: Simple biological rule replaces complex activation functions
- **Synaptic Delays**: Realistic transmission delays based on distance and connection type
- **Activity-Dependent Adaptation**: Networks self-regulate and maintain stability

### Dynamic Network Architecture
- **Neurogenesis**: Create new neurons during runtime based on activity and need
- **Synaptogenesis**: Form new connections through biological growth rules
- **Structural Plasticity**: Automatic pruning of weak or inactive connections
- **Runtime Connectivity**: Add/remove connections while networks are actively processing
- **Spatial Organization**: 3D positioning with distance-based connection rules

### Performance & Scalability
- **1.2M+ operations/second**: Validated high-throughput performance
- **Sub-millisecond latency**: Average 676μs response time under load
- **99.38% success rate**: Excellent reliability under extreme concurrent stress
- **2000+ concurrent operations**: Massive parallelism without blocking
- **Linear scaling**: Performance scales with available CPU cores
- **Memory efficient**: ~2KB per neuron, efficient resource utilization

### Advanced Learning Systems
- **Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity**: Precise timing-based learning (validated against Bi & Poo 1998)
- **Homeostatic Regulation**: Automatic firing rate control and network stability
- **Synaptic Scaling**: Input strength normalization preserving learned patterns
- **Competitive Learning**: Winner-take-all dynamics and input selectivity
- **Continuous Adaptation**: Learning never stops - networks adapt in real-time

    input <- neuron.Message{Value: 0.7}  // Below threshold

    input <- neuron.Message{Value: 0.5}  // Total: ~1.2 > threshold - FIRES!
