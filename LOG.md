# STDP Bug Fix Summary (July 8, 2025)

## Issue Identified
We identified a critical bug in the STDP (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) implementation where the system was using `LastActivity` instead of `LastTransmission` to calculate timing differences between pre and post-synaptic spikes.

## Root Cause
- The `processSTDPFeedback` method in `stdp_signaling.go` was incorrectly using `synapse.LastActivity` for timing calculations
- `LastActivity` is ambiguous and could refer to either transmission or plasticity events
- This inconsistency was causing incorrect timing relationships for STDP, resulting in test failures

## Fix Implemented
Modified the `processSTDPFeedback` method to explicitly use `synapse.LastTransmission` instead of `synapse.LastActivity`:
```go
// Changed from:
// deltaT := synapse.LastActivity.Sub(postSpikeTime)

// To:
deltaT := synapse.LastTransmission.Sub(postSpikeTime)
```

## Test Updates
Updated unit tests to populate both `LastActivity` and `LastTransmission` fields with the same values to ensure compatibility with the fixed implementation while maintaining the original test logic.

## Verification
Tested the changes with `TestSTDPSignaling_` tests to ensure the STDP system now correctly handles timing differences, but still encountering an issue with positive deltaT calculation which requires further debugging.

## Next Steps
Add detailed debugging to diagnose the remaining issue with positive deltaT calculations in the STDP tests.
